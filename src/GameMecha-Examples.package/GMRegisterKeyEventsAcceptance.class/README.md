This is an acceptance test for the GMKeyHandler class. It is supposed to be opened like any other morph.
It demonstrates how to register/deregister a morph to the KeyHandler and how to check whether a key is pressed using the ability of the GMKeyHandler to register blocks and methods for a specific keyboard key.

See initialize and step to find out how it works.
