This is an acceptance test for the GM collision mechanics. It is supposed to be opened like any other morph.
It demonstrates how to use the GM collision handling.

Once opened, it displays various morphs. All morphs colored red collide with another morph, the others are colored green.

The most important methods for collision detection are 'initialize' and 'collisionMorphXXXXXX', which display how to prepare a morph for collision, and 'step', which checks whether morphs are colliding.
