This is an acceptance test for the GMKeyHandler class. It is supposed to be opened like any other morph.
It demonstrates how to register a morph to the KeyHandler and how to check whether a key is pressed.

For more details see the initialize method or the step method of GMKeyHandlerAcceptanceTestKeyMorph.
