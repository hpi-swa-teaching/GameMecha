The CollisionHandler checks for collidees of a specific morph on request. morphsCollidingWith: aMorph will return all registered morphs colliding with said morph. Morphs can be registered by addMorph: aMorph and thus will be considered in future collision checks. The CollisionHandler expects each morph to have a CollisionDetectionStrategy. The method is: aMorph collidingWith: anotherMorph provides a way to check whether two specific morphs are colliding with each other.
